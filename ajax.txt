    Synchronus JS - waits for one action to complete before moving onto the next (false)
        javascript code runs on a single thread (can do 1 thing at a time)
        the code waits for 1 action to complete before moving on to the next
        request runs and awaits until it that file is completely read, blocking the rest of the code
        var = readSync(); console.log();
        
    Asynchronous JS - JS you write only runs on one thread (true) 
        request runs outside of JS, then callback function adds it on to the que
        readSync( , function(){console.log()};
        
    Async Flow Control - 
        Callbacks - good
        Promises - better
        Generators - awesome

    Communicate with a server by making an http request
    No need to reload the page
